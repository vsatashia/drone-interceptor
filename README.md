ESE 6500 Final Project.

Adds functionality to [rotorpy](https://github.com/spencerfolk/rotorpy) with a camera model that incorportes motion blur and trajectory opimization to reach dynamic targets

# Instructions

Source the virtual environment under `bin/` or create your own.

Afterwards, install the `rotorpy` package with `pip install -e .`.

Finally, run the code `python examples/final.py`

Within `examples/final.py` you can specify the hoop trajectory in `hoop_pose` and mess with simulate parameters for the heatmap sweep or the single run.
